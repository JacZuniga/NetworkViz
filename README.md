Project Summary

For our network analysis project, we decided to explore the connections between Spotify artists to understand how musical collaboration and similarity create networks in the music industry. We obtained a dataset containing artist nodes and their relationships, which allowed us to examine collaboration patterns and identify influential artists who serve as bridges between different musical communities.

Our analysis focused on visualizing the network structure, calculating centrality measures to identify key artists, and performing community detection to understand how artists cluster together. We were particularly interested in finding out which artists have the most connections and how the overall network structure reveals patterns in musical collaboration. Through various visualization techniques and statistical analysis, we discovered interesting insights about the connectivity patterns and community structures within the Spotify artist ecosystem.


Conclusions and Key Findings


Our analysis of the Spotify artist network revealed several important insights about how artists connect and collaborate in the music industry. The network contains 1.5632^{5} artists connected through 3.00379^{5} relationships, with an average of 3.84 connections per artist. We identified 4464 distinct communities, suggesting that artists naturally cluster into groups that likely represent different genres, collaborative circles, or regional music scenes.

The most significant finding is the presence of highly connected “hub” artists who serve as bridges between different musical communities. These artists play a crucial role in maintaining the overall connectivity of the network and facilitating cross-genre collaboration. The visualizations clearly show both the tight-knit nature of individual communities and the broader network structure that connects them. This pattern suggests that while artists tend to work within specific musical circles, there are key individuals who help connect these circles and enable the flow of musical influence across different genres and communities.
